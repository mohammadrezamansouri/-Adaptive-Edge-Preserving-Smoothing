# Adaptive Edge-Preserving Smoothing Filter Implementation  

This project is a Python implementation of the *"Intensity and Scale Adjustable Edge-Preserving Smoothing Filter"* by Kazu Mishiba. The method improves traditional edge-preserving filters by introducing real-time control over both edge intensity and scale. By utilizing a novel variance-based metric, it effectively smooths textures while preserving significant edges, making it suitable for real-time image processing applications.  

I developed this simulation as part of my studies in the **Image Processing** course during my **Master's program**. The goal was to better understand advanced edge-preserving filtering techniques and their impact on image smoothing while maintaining structural details. Through this implementation, I explored how adaptive filtering can enhance image quality and improve noise reduction without compromising essential textures and object boundaries.  

This project serves as both a learning experience and a practical demonstration of modern edge-aware filtering techniques.
